  <p> <b>Divide</b> your hair into 4 sections by parting vertically straight down the middle, and then again horizontally about halfway down the back of your head.</p>
<p><i>Section the large sectioninto smaller sections.</i> Grab a small section and divide it into 3 parts. Apply mousse or gel, and run a comb through it to detangle.</p>
<p>Braid 2-3 links and add the synthetic hair. Then, braid 2-3 links, add synthetic hair to a new section, again braid 2-3 links, then add synthetic hair to the final section.
Keep braiding down to the tips of your hair, then dip the braid ends in boiling water to seal them and enjoy! They should last for about 6 weeks.
